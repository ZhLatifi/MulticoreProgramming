# MulticoreProgramming
C++ Codes for AUT Multicore Programming Course

Here are my solutions to Amirkabir University of Technology Multicore Programming course (OpenMP and CUDA) assignments.
List of some common highly parallelizable algorithms that have been implemented is:

1. Parallelization of a computationally intensive serial task - OpenMP (Lab1)
2. Matrix addition with both 1D and 2D decompositions - OpenMP (Lab2)
3. Using Parallel Studio tools to parallelize the serial task in principle (Lab3)
4. Prefix sum (subarray prefix sum - Hillis and Steele) - OpenMP (Lab4)
5. Vector addition - CUDA (Lab5)
6. Prefix sum (subarray prefix sum - Hillis and Steele) - CUDA (Lab6)
7. Optimizing a matrix multiplication kernel - CUDA (HW6)
8. Implementing VGG16 classification network using CUDA and OpenMP (Final Projrct)

The instructions for each assignment are available alongside my reports in the assignment's directory.
